## 3.0 Alerts
### 3.1 CSRF attack
>>>>>>> Passive (10202 - Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens)

### Identification
CSRF stands for Cross Site Request Forgery. CSRF is a type of security vulnerability that can occur in web application when an attacker creates a malicious page that make a request to the server on behalf of the victim's authentication or session identification cookie. Cross-site request forgery is the practise of tricking a user's browser into sending a request to a target web app on their behalf. The web application's trust in the user's browser is exploited by the attack. The user can be tricked into visiting a malicious website or clicking on a specifically created link, which the attacker can use to carry out unauthorised actions on the targeted web application.

### Evaluation 
- Risk: medium
- Confidence: high
- CWE ID: 352
- WASC ID: 9
- Source: Passive (10202 - Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens)

Based on the result after scan the vulnerabilities on OWASP, this website has 314 absences of anti-CSRF tokens on the HTML form.

One of the evidence is 
```HTML
<form action="https://kulliyyah.iium.edu.my/ahaskirkhs/wp-comments-post.php" method="post" id="commentform" class="comment-form">
```
### Prevention
In order to prevent CSRF attack, we can implement the anti - CSRF token. CSRF token is a unique value that is generated by the server and sent to the client as a hidden input field in the form. When the user submits the form, the value of token is also sent back to the server. The server then checks to make sure that the value of token matches what it expects. If the value dont match, the server knows that the request was not initiated bu the actual user and can reject it.  The risk level of this threat is medium, which means this security issue has potential to cause moderate harm to the system. 

Implementing anti-CSRF token: 
 
In server side : php
```PHP
<?php
// Generate and store CSRF token in the user's session
session_start();
$csrfToken = bin2hex(random_bytes(32)); // Generate a random token
$_SESSION['csrf_token'] = $csrfToken; // Store the token in the session
?>
```

In code above, the CSRF token generated using secure random value generation function randoom_bytes(). Then the generated token is stored in the user's session $_SESSION['csrf_token'] for later validation.

In HTML form 

```HTML
<form action="https://kulliyyah.iium.edu.my/ahaskirkhs/wp-comments-post.php" method="post" id="commentform" class="comment-form">
  <!-- Include the CSRF token as a hidden input field -->
  <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="<?php echo $csrfToken; ?>">
  
  <!-- Other form fields -->
  <!-- ... -->
  
  <!-- Submit button -->
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

In HTML, the CSRF token included as hidden input field (  ```HTML <input type="hidden" >```). The name attribute of the input field (name="csrf_token") is to identify when the form is submitted. The value attribute (value="<?php echo $csrfToken; ?>") is to dynamically insert token into HTML. 

The CSRF token will be part of the form data when it is submitted. To confirm the validity of the form submission and guard against CSRF attacks, server-side validation of the submitted token against the stored token in the user's session is an option.

Another way to mitigate the CSRF attack is to apply the double submitting cookies, here two various ways exist for the CSRF token to be transmitted: as a cookie (which is automatically sent with every request) and as a hidden field in the form (which is manually submitted with the request by the user submitting the form). The server may confirm that the request was performed on purpose by the user from the same origin by comparing the two values.

It will be challenging to match the CSRF token values if an attacker tries to fake a request by submitting a form from a different website because they won't have access to the user's CSRF token cookie.

In addition, preventing the XSS first could help to prevent CSRF. Enabling user interation whenever user needs to perform update to the sensitive data also able to mitigate the CSRF attacks because the attacker still needs to get the user's actual password. This could be done by implementing reauthentication mechanisms, CAPTCHA challenges, and one time token.

### 3.2 CSP
- (Ghozi)
>>>>> Passive (10038 - Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set)
CWE ID : 693

Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.

For a website without a CSP header, the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability can be high. The likelihood of the vulnerability being exploited can also be high since attacks like XSS and clickjacking are commonly exploited by attackers. The level of access required to exploit the vulnerability can be low since these attacks can be carried out using a standard web browser.

This is the result based on the automated scan on OWASP:

- URL: [https://kulliyyah.iium.edu.my/koe/](https://kulliyyah.iium.edu.my/koe/)
- Risk: medium
- Confidence: high
- CWE ID: 693
- WASC ID: 15
- Source: Passive (10038 - Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set)

#### Evaluation using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:

Confidentiality: The lack of a CSP header can allow attackers to steal sensitive information from the website's users, such as login credentials or personal information. This can have a high impact on the confidentiality of the website's data. CVSS score: 7.0

Integrity: Without a CSP header, attackers can modify the website's content, including injecting malicious scripts, defacing the website, or manipulating user data. This can have a high impact on the website's integrity. CVSS score: 7.0

Availability: Attackers can also launch a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on the website, which can make it unavailable to legitimate users. This can have a moderate to high impact on the website's availability. CVSS score: 5.0

Likelihood of the Vulnerability Being Exploited:
The likelihood of the vulnerability being exploited is high, as attacks like XSS, clickjacking, and data injection are common and can be carried out with minimal technical knowledge or resources. CVSS score: 8.0

Level of Access Required to Exploit the Vulnerability:
The level of access required to exploit the vulnerability is low, as attacks can be carried out using a standard web browser. CVSS score: 3.0

- Base Score = (0.6 * Impact + 0.4 * Exploitability - 1.5) * f(Impact)
- Base Score: 6.4 (rounded up from 6.33)

In conclusion, the lack of a CSP header on a website can be evaluated as a high-severity vulnerability with a CVSS base score of 6.4. Website owners should take immediate steps to implement a CSP header to mitigate the risk of attacks that exploit this vulnerability.

#### Prevent the vulnerability:
- Define which sources of content are allowed to be loaded on the website.
- Set the CSP header using the Content-Security-Policy HTTP header.
- Test the CSP header to ensure it's not blocking legitimate content.
- Monitor and update the CSP header as needed to address new vulnerabilities.

This is an example of how the CSP header looks like:
```HTML
<meta
  http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
  content="default-src 'self'; img-src https://kulliyyah.iium.edu.my/koe/; child-src 'none';" />

```

### 3.3 JS Library
- (Ameer Al-Wafiq bin Norazam - 2119005)
>>>>>>> Passive (10003 - Vulnerable JS Library (Powered by Retire.js))
CWE ID : 829

#### Identification
JavaScript Library or JS Library is a collection of pre-written JavaScript codes that can be easily integrated with application projects. This re-writing of code and recognizing that certain JS functions need to be implemented multiple times led to the development of JavaScript libraries and frameworks. These libraries can provide a variety of benefits such as performance improvement, cross-browser compatibility and best practices to follow the latest development trends.

The Vulnerable JS Library is a common security issue that occurs when a web application uses outdated or unpatched JavaScript libraries. The users cannot ignore the updates as using a library with missing security patches can make the web application easily exploited.

Moreover, the use of third-party JavaScript libraries can introduce a range of DOM-based vulnerabilities, including some that can be used to hijack user accounts like DOM-based XSS vulnerability. Furthermore, common JavaScript libraries typically have a lot of users taking care of them. This means that bugs are quickly identified and patched upstream, resulting in a steady stream of security updates that need to be applied. Some library vulnerabilities expose every application that imports the library, but others only affect applications that use certain library features.

#### Evaluation 
This is the result for the Vulnerable JS Library which gives 27 alerts:

- Risk: Medium
- Confidence: Medium
- CWE ID: 829
- Source: Passive (10003 - Vulnerable JS Library (Powered by Retire.js))

For this case study's web application, it has a CWE-829 vulnerability, which is caused by the improper validation of user input that is used to import, require, or include executable functionality (such as a library) from a source outside of the intended control sphere, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code and potentially execute it on the affected system.

A Vulnerable JS Library can lead to a breach of confidentiality if an attacker is able to exploit the vulnerability to gain access to sensitive data. In the case of CVE-2022-31160, the vulnerability is related to cross-site scripting (XSS) and could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the web application, potentially leading to the theft of sensitive data.

On top of that, Vulnerable JS Library can lead to a breach of integrity if an attacker is able to exploit the vulnerability to modify data or inject malicious code into the web application. In the case of CVE-2022-31160, the vulnerability is related to XSS and could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the web application, potentially leading to the modification of data or other unintended consequences.

Lastly, Vulnerable JS Library also can lead to a breach of availability if an attacker is able to exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service (DoS) attack or otherwise disrupt the functioning of the web application. In the case of CVE-2022-31160, the vulnerability is related to XSS and could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the web application, potentially leading to a DoS attack. 

In summary, a vulnerable JavaScript library in a web application can have a significant impact on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. In the case of CVE-2022-31160, the vulnerability is related to XSS and has a medium impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, with a CVSS score of 5.3, 6.5, and 6.1 respectively.

#### Prevention / Mitigation
The developers are advised to upgrade to the latest version of the respective JavaScript Library to ensure they are up-to-date and secure. They also need to ensure that a patch-management strategy takes place and executed, to ensure that security updates are promptly applied to all third-party libraries in the web application. 
- This includes remove unused dependencies, unnecessary features, components, files, and documentation.
- Continuously inventory the versions of both client-side and server-side components and their dependencies using tools like versions, OWASP Dependency Check, retire.js, etc.
- Continuously monitor sources like Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) and National Vulnerability Database (NVD) for vulnerabilities in the components. 
- Only obtain the set of JS Library components from official sources and from secure links. Prefer signed packages to reduce the chance of including the vulnerable ones.

For the vulnerabilities specifically for the web application in this case study, the vulnerability lies in the JS Library for the jquery-ui and moment.js. These two libraries are vulnerable due to their versions are not the latest one.
For the jquery-ui library used in this web application is the version 1.12.1 while the library for moment.js is the version 2.29.1. Both of the versions need to be updated and the updated version of both of them is need to be used in order to reduce the vulnerability.

Developers can use update the jquery-ui to version 1.13.2 where the issue is fixed based on CVE-2022-31160 where version prior to 1.13.2 are potentially vulnerable to cross-site scripting.

### 3.4 Information Disclosure
- (Md Mostafizur Rahman Rahat - 1823811)
>>>>>>> Passive (10023 - Information Disclosure - Debug Error Messages)
CWE ID : 200

#### Defination
When an application fails to adequately safeguard sensitive and private information from exposure to users who are not ordinarily authorized to access that data, this is known as information disclosure. An application failing to protect information correctly may result in information disclosure. Even if such flaws cannot be exploited in most situations, web application security experts still consider them problematic. This is due to the fact that they enable malevolent hackers to collect vital information that may be utilized later in the attack lifecycle. Attackers, when armed with such data, are able to do considerably more than they would be able to if they did not have it.

The failure to disable debugging and diagnostic features can sometimes provide attackers with useful tools to help them obtain sensitive information, and developer comments in markup are sometimes visible to users in the production environment. It is possible for attackers to enumerate sensitive data, such as valid user passwords, if a website sends separate replies when different error conditions occur, as is the case when using the default setup.

Information disclosure vulnerabilities may have direct and indirect effects, depending on the website's aim and what an attacker can access. Spreading private information may have a major effect on impacted parties. Leaking technical details like directory structure or third-party frameworks may not have a direct effect. This might be the key to many additional vulnerabilities in the wrong hands. How the attacker uses this information determines the degree of damage.

#### Automated Scan Rsults from OWASP
The outcome of an automated OWASP scan for information disclosure is as follows:
- URL: https://kulliyyah.iium.edu.my/koe/
- Risk: low
- Confidence: medium
- CWE ID: 200
- WASC ID: 13
- Source: Passive (10023 - Information Disclosure - Debug Error Messages)

Risk : The risk of information disclosure is low when the potential for abuse or damage is low. Thus, disclosing some sensitive information has no significant effect.

Confidence : Medium confidence suggests there is some evidence or suggestion that the given information is sensitive, but there is still a little uncertainty or doubt. Thus, the provided information may represent a danger or threat, but additional study may be required to prove its authenticity. In some cases, the confidence level of information disclosure may also be affected by the severity or potential impact of the disclosed information. the exposed information involves sensitive personal or financial data or might cause considerable damages or financial loss, the impact may be greater.

CWE ID - 200 : CWE-200 is the CWE designation for "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorised Actor" in software security. A security breach occurs when confidential information is accidentally shared with the wrong person or system. Passwords, bank data, personal identifying information, and other private data are all sensitive information that might be hacked.

WASC ID - 13 : For online applications, "Information Leakage and Improper Error Handling" is WASC (Web Application Security Consortium) ID 13's area of concern. Information exposure through error messages, insecure error handling, and debug information leaking are all examples of vulnerabilities in this class that might compromise a website's or server's security.

Passive - 10023 : "Passive (10023 - Information Disclosure - Debug Error Messages)" may refer to a web application vulnerability that exposes sensitive data via debug error messages.
 Attackers may leverage stack traces, variable names, and database queries in debugging error messages to find and exploit program vulnerabilities.
 
#### Mitigation
Information disclosure security risks are serious. They enable hackers to get valuable and sensitive information about their target by doing simple tests or searching public sites. 
- Avoid sending response headers or background information that reveals backend technology type, version, or configuration from the website's server.
- Make sure open server port services don't leak their builds and versions.
- When the web application fails, handle all exceptions and ensure no technical information is provided.
- Never hardcode credentials, API keys, IP addresses, first names, or last names in the code, even in comments.
- Never upload sensitive data, files, or other material to web servers.
- Check each request to create/edit/view/delete resources for correct access restrictions to avoid privilege escalation and protect personal information.
- Backend programming should use enough validations to detect all errors and avoid data leaks.
- Disallow directory listing on the web server and force the web application to display a default page.

### 3.5 Potential XSS
- (Abdul Rashid bin Nuhairi - 1911767)
>>>>>>> Passive (10031 - User Controllable HTML Element Attribute (Potential XSS))
CWE ID : 20

Here are the results from OWASP ZAP that has been noted and its brief.

Description: User-controllable HTML element attribute (potential XSS) is a type of vulnerability that can exist in websites, including those built using Wordpress. This vulnerability occurs when a website allows users to control certain attributes of HTML elements, such as the "src" attribute of an image tag or the "href" attribute of a link tag, without properly validating or sanitizing the input.

Risk: informational - "Risk: informational" means that the vulnerability identified by the tool does not pose an immediate threat or allow for direct exploitation, but provides information that could be used by an attacker to further exploit vulnerabilities or launch a more sophisticated attack. These types of vulnerabilities do not usually require immediate remediation, but should be addressed as part of an overall security program.

Confidence: low - "Confidence: low" means that the tool is not completely certain that the identified vulnerability exists. The confidence level is based on the reliability and accuracy of the tool's detection mechanisms, and is influenced by various factors such as the complexity of the application, the depth of the scan, and the level of interaction with the target.

Source: passive (10031) - "Source: passive (10031)" refers to the method used by the tool to detect the vulnerability. "Passive" means that the tool is monitoring network traffic and analyzing responses from the target, without actually sending any payloads or inputs that could affect the application. "10031" is a unique identifier for the specific plugin or rule that detected the vulnerability. In this case, it could refer to a plugin or rule related to information disclosure or sensitive data leakage.

CWE ID: 20 refers to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifier for the vulnerability category "Improper Input Validation." CWE is a community-developed dictionary of common software security weaknesses, which provides a standardized language for describing security vulnerabilities in software and hardware.
Specifically, CWE ID: 20 refers to cases where input from a user or an external system is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to inject malicious data into the system or execute unintended actions.

WASC ID: 20 refers to the Web Application Security Consortium (WASC) identifier for the vulnerability category "Improper Input Handling." WASC is a group of international experts in web application security, who have created a set of guidelines and best practices for securing web applications.

Prevention: To prevent user-controllable HTML element attribute vulnerabilities and potential XSS attacks, it's important to properly validate and sanitize all user input on the server-side, and to use secure coding practices when developing websites and web applications. Additionally, websites should use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the types of content that can be loaded on their pages, which can help mitigate the impact of XSS attacks. . Additionally, WordPress provides several built-in functions and plugins that can be used to sanitize and validate user input, but it's up to website developers to implement them correctly.
